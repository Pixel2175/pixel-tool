# Pixel Tool

Hey there! Welcome to Pixel Tool, my little project to make Windows run smoother and faster.

Ever felt like your Windows PC is bogged down with stuff you don't need? That's where Pixel Tool comes in. It's a neat little app I whipped up to tweak Windows, get rid of the bloat, and help you download some extra tools that'll give your system a nice performance boost.

The best part? It's super small (just 18.6 MB!) and totally portable. No need to install anything - just run it and you're good to go. I made sure it's really easy to use, so you don't need to be a tech whiz to speed up your PC.

Oh, and don't worry about updates. Pixel Tool got its own auto-updater, so you'll always have the latest version without any fuss.

Give it a try if you want to breathe some new life into your Windows machine. It's amazing what a bit of tweaking and debloating can do!
